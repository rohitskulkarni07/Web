Do not relay on UI test
Use BDD except if stakeholder knows codding
test design pattern should be used!
never use sleep()
name your test-cases wisely
if possible use parralel test
use soft assertion (go on if fail)
Hard assertion (stop if fail)
Do not use lots of comenting
use wise comenting
use wait
