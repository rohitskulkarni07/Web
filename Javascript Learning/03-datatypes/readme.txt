    Number  => 1, 10, 0.01, 1.0132312...etc
    Boolean => true/false

    Undefined => un-assigned value by default

    Functions
    Datatypes
    Anything Else...


    Js Is Dynamically Typed Language, types associated with values not with variables
same variable can hold multiple values, no need to specify type!
