        Hi! My name is <em>not so important</em> and I am enthusiast in graphics coding also known Real Time Rendering or Game
        Programming or just RTR
    </p>
    <p>
        even though there are multiple platform to design special effects and games
        creating those in native programming like in<strong> C </strong>and<strong> C++ </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        which more fun because while creating those
        graphics components you always know what is going on under the hood...
